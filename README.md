# [Analyzing Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/1962)

## Project Description
Unlock the secrets of flight delays and cancellations with data analysis! Dive into the world of aviation data to identify key factors and airlines most affected by disruptions in the Pacific Northwest by using your data wrangling, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis skills.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the data from the [pnwflights2022](https://github.com/moderndive/pnwflights22) datasets available from the [ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/) team exported as CSV files.


My solution to the project is [analyzing_flight_delays_and_cancellations.ipynb](analyzing_flight_delays_and_cancellations.ipynb).

I also [recreated](data/create_csv_data_sets.ipynb) the CSV data using Python from the original RData sources.
